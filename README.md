In this thesis entitled “Serious Games – A Case Study”, the design and implementation of a serious game is presented, which focuses on informing the players about the history and cultural heritage of the Mon Repos estate in Corfu. Within the game, the player receives texts, photos and videos related to historical sites of the Mon Repos estate. The player is also asked to answer several sets of multiple-choice questions aimed at self – assessment. The goal of the game is to spark the interest of players in the history and cultural heritage of the Mon Repos estate. The game was designed using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language.
